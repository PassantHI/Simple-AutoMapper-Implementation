my recent learning experience with AutoMapper in .NET!

AutoMapper is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of object mapping, allowing you to transform data between different object models with minimal effort. Whether you're working on DTOs or complex data transformations, it can save time and reduce manual mapping code.

ðŸ”§ In this example, I demonstrate how to map between two models using AutoMapper with a few lines of code.
Key benefits of AutoMapper:

Reduces repetitive mapping code
Increases maintainability of your project
